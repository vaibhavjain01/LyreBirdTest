Project Directory Structure
There are 4 packages:
1) Controller: The classes that pull data from view, run logic in Model and push data back to view.
2) Model: The classes that contain the business logic and represent entities.
3) View: The view is just used to provide user interactions.
4) Resources: There are two files that have been used. One of them is the language configuration file, and another one, contains member registrations from previous runs.

There is a "AppConfig" file, which is used to contain global declarations and constants.
